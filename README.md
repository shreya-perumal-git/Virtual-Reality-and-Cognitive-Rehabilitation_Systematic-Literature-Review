# Virtual Reality and Cognitive Rehabilitation: Systematic Literature Review

This project is a **systematic literature review investigating how effective Virtual Reality (VR) is as a tool for cognitive and motor rehabilitation in patients with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The project follows three key stages:

Protocol Development (Week 1–2)

Purpose: Establish the foundation of the review by defining the research question, objectives, inclusion/exclusion criteria, databases to be searched, and keywords.

Deliverable: A written protocol document ensuring clarity and consistency across the team and guiding the entire review process

.

Search and Screening (Week 3–5)

Purpose: Execute systematic searches using databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus with predefined queries. Screen papers in two phases:

Title/Abstract screening: Remove irrelevant studies.

Full-text screening: Apply inclusion criteria (e.g., focus on VR, TBI patients, published after 2016).

Deliverable: A refined list of relevant studies visualized in a PRISMA flow diagram showing how papers were filtered

.

Summary of Findings (Week 6–8)

Purpose: Extract data from the final set of included papers (study design, demographics, VR intervention, outcomes). Synthesize results into key themes such as improvements in memory, motor function, or patient motivation.

Deliverable: A Summary of Findings report highlighting VR’s benefits, limitations, and recommendations for integration in rehabilitation program
